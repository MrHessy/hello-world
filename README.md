# hello-world
My repository for future projects

I'm a 22 year old man living in The Netherlands.
Currently I am studying proggraming languages like C# and Javascript, also HTML5 and CSS3.
I also want to learn more about ASP.NET and SQL Databases and eventually I would like to dive into Unity3D to develop mobile games and maybe in the fute also mobile applications.
